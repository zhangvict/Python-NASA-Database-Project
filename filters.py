"""Provide filters for querying close approaches and limit the generated results.

The `create_filters` function produces a collection of objects that is used by
the `query` method to generate a stream of `CloseApproach` objects that match
all of the desired criteria. The arguments to `create_filters` are provided by
the main module and originate from the user's command-line options.

This function can be thought to return a collection of instances of subclasses
of `AttributeFilter` - a 1-argument callable (on a `CloseApproach`) constructed
from a comparator (from the `operator` module), a reference value, and a class
method `get` that subclasses can override to fetch an attribute of interest from
the supplied `CloseApproach`.

The `limit` function simply limits the maximum number of values produced by an
iterator.

    An `AttributeFilter` represents the search criteria pattern comparing some

    object satisfies the encoded criterion.

    It is constructed with a comparator operator and a reference value, and
    calling the filter (with __call__) executes `get(approach) OP value` (in

    Concrete subclasses can override the `get` class method to provide custom
